_Daguerreotype_ is a modern JavaScript library for snapshot testing in JavaScript.

It is currently compatible with Mocha and provides customizable paths for configuration and snapshot output unlike other libraries.

## Usage

```sh
npm i daguerreotype
```

Then in your tests, do

```ts
import {deepStrictEqualSnapshot} from 'daguerreotype';

describe(..., () => {
    it(..., async () => {
        const someData = ...;

        deepStrictEqualSnapshot(someData);
    })
})
```
